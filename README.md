# Brandon's Tandem Trivia

This trivia game is a product of a coding challenge from Tandem. A 10-question multiple choice question game. Hope you enjoy!

`npm install`

Once the node modules and dev dependencies are installed, please run:

## Features to add in the future

If I had more time, I would have liked to implement a feature to:

- add more time (e.g. a user can click a button only once to add +5 seconds to the timer)
- give hints (e.g. a user can click a button to get a hint, which would cross out one of the incorrect answer choices)
- make transitions of questions (e.g. creating cool slide in / slide out transitions for when the questionsn change)
